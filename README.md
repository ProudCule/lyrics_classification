# Lyrics-based classification of songs 
## Stanford CS 221 Fall 2016 Mini Project
Author: Dhruv Joshi

The purpose of this course mini-project is to build an NLP system for the classification of songs based only on their lyrical content. Will make use of the Million Song dataset and lyrics provided with it (and genre classifications).

Commits will be pushed to this repo throughout November and December 2016. Thereafter, this may evolve into an audio-based music recommendation system in tandem.
